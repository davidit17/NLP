The Mageean Cup is awarded annually to the winners of the Ulster 
Colleges' Senior Hurling Championship. This iconic trophy was 
presented to Ulster Colleges in 1963 by the staff and students
 of Dromantine College, Newry in memory of Most Reverend Daniel Mageean
 , Bishop of Down and Connor (1929 â€“ 1962).[1] St Mary's CBGS Belfast
 are the cup specialists with 28 titles. The cup has spent most of its
 time in the Belfast school with only St Patricks Maghera challenging 
 their dominance
